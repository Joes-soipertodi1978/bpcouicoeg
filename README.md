Man, just stumbled out of that theater like I'd been in a time warp or something. Fountain of Youth, whoa. It’s like my brain’s been through a blender, you know? Noisy as hell too, someone behind me wouldn’t quit rustling their candy wrapper during the big reveal. Why’s the sticky floor always steal my left shoe but never the right? And now I've got popcorn crumbs doing a jig down my shirt.

> Okay, so this  . Starts off like one of those smooth sailing boat rides that slowly just capsizes. I mean, what was up with that guy who looked like he walked out of a Baroque painting? Was he even real or am I mixing him up with that dude from the grocery store last week? Anyway, the fountain wasn’t even a fountain, more like a 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬y garden hose tied up like it belonged at a yard sale. Can’t say I didn’t love how they swirled time around like spaghetti on a fork though, even if the butter slipped off somewhere.

The scene with the parrot—who just keeps a parrot in their attic like a forgotten French novel? Or maybe I dreamt that part? It’s like the director just flicked through history and pinned random notes with a dart and tequila. But, right, the paradox bit with the 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, wasn’t expecting that twist! Like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 two squirrels play chess just as the rain starts.

You gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , I swear, it's just–feel it wrap around your braincells, or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨’s your thing. Remember when they opened the treasure chest and it's just mirrors? Honestly makes you think, or at least question if you left the stove on at home.

And, the music, man, like someone tossed Beethoven and an 8-bit soundtrack into a blender, full blast loud too. And my back? Feels like I’ve been wrestling with a hay bale. That bit with the ancient recipe for eternal youth, pretty sure I recognized my Nana’s handwriting. Or maybe I just need more sleep.
